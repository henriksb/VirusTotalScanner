# 📃 What is VirusTotalScanner?

VirusTotalScanner is a Python script that utilizes the VirusTotal API to scan local files for malware. Instead of only scanning your sketchy software with one anti-virus, why not scan it with 50-70? VirusTotal lets us check if someone has scanned the program before and quickly gives us the scan result, and if not, it can do an entirely new scan. This Python script makes this very easy to use by adding both of these options to your context menu. This makes using VirusTotal as easy as two clicks, and after your scan, you will get a pop-up message in your tray with the detection rate. It will also produce a more detailed text file to see which anti-virus detected your program and what it detected.
